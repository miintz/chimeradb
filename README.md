### Overhaul Branch 1 ###

Right then, so i've decided enough's enough and have dusted off my old database object, or the 'generic-database-generator-for-random-types-and-cookies-for-the-masses' project as it was commonly known. 

As it stands now it is a bit rickety, i may need to do some serious debugging to get it working again. Being as i am, i have left no documentation for myself whatsoever, but loads of comments of varying use in the code. The word 'hack' alone pops up over 50 times. Not good.

Anyway, i want to merge this branch with master when i get the following things sorted:

- Read through all the nonsense comments
- Get rid of the ElementId fields
- Turn it into a library
